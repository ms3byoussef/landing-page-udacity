#Udacity landings page project

This is my landingspage made for the Udacity Frond end Webdevelopment nanodegree course,
it comes with a dynamically structured navigation bars,
smooth scrolling and active section indicator.

Used StackOverflow and developer.mozilla for information.


## the languages used:

## HTML

The HTML File (index.html) contain the static starter page.

## CSS

THE CSS File (style.css) contain the Projects styles.
The (active) class style has been added to it.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript file (app.js) will generate the dynamic parts

I used several ES6 methods and also Javascript and browser functions which are only available in the latest modern browsers
Most of the changes have happened in the js/app.js file and some changes for styling in styles.css
